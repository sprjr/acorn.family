            <p>
                I love helping people build & ship great things, <em>together</em>. Most recently
                I did this at Netflix as an Engineering Manager, but I've been fortunate to be
                able to do this in lots of different ways for lots of different teams & projects.

                I used to live in San Francisco, but have since moved back to Orlando to spend
                more quality time with my wife & daughter. I think people & relationships are the
                most important things we can have (even at work!) and I try my best to focus on
                balancing that not just for myself but for others in my circles as well.
