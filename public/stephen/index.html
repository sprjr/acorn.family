            <p>I love helping people build &amp; ship software, <em>together</em>. Most recently I did this at Netflix as an Engineering Manager but I've been fortunate to be able to do this in many different ways for many different teams and projects over the last 10 years of my career.</p>

            <p>I used to live in San Francisco but recently my wife &amp; I moved back to Orlando to spend more quality time near our daughter. I believe people and relationships are the most important things we all have (even at work!). I try my best to focus on balancing that not just for myself but for others around me. I care a lot about people individually, and I try my best to make space for them on the teams I work with so everyone can feel welcome, unique, valued, and necessary &mdash; as well as balanced & safe.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, software is the easy part &mdash; especially if you invest in and progress on growing people and cohesive, collaborative teams.</p>
