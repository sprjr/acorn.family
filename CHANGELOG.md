## [1.2.0] 2016-07-31
- Introduced `create-react-app`, which replaces the node server but enables
developing the UI in <React />. I believe this is preferable to the initial
goals for tinkering here. We may need to have more control of the 'server'
side in the future, but we can explore that when the time comes.

## [1.1.0] 2016-07-26
- Introduced simple express 'hello world' server
- [Deployed](https://acornfamilysite-wffuigrrjl.now.sh/) to zeit.co, [_src](https://acornfamilysite-wffuigrrjl.now.sh/_src)

## [1.0.0] 2016-07-26
- Initial github, npmjs setup.
